<h1>SFU Galleries Digital Strategy, 2024 - readme </h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<a name="readme-about"></a>

<p>The SFU Galleries Digital Strategy document is a recommended framework and roadmap to answer the question: "How can we effectively integrate digital solutions and produce high-quality content within the framework of SFU Galleries' operations and systems?" While digital solutions (and possibilities) are already being used within SFU Galleries' offerings and daily workforce, this document is designed to help better manage and streamline processes where digital content, tools, and communication are managed by multiple people, often across multiple locations. This document also considers that digital solutions are often implemented more quickly and casually now than ever as staff, artists, contractors, and audiences integrate smart devices and internet-enabled technology into their daily lives and interactions. Many digital processes are being incorporated into the workplace in innocent and often productive ways so quickly that they become integrated into processes before administrators or planners know of a shift in operations. </p>
<p>The 2024 Digital Strategic Plan is designed as a living document intended to be agile and adaptive as technology evolves. It is informed by the <a href="https://github.com/sfu-galleries/digital-accessibility-needs-assessment/blob/main/index.html">Digital Needs Assessment Report</a> and the existing SFU Galleries Strategic Plan (2020-2025). It takes a high-level approach to planning to help create a compass for SFU Galleries without tying the organization to a linear path. This document serves as a framework to address digital inclusion, accessibility, and the ever-changing needs of SFU Galleries' audience. It provides valuable insights into existing barriers and opportunities for change, acknowledging that some barriers may require additional resources to overcome. The knowledge gained from this document is equally important as solving conflicts or completing tasks. By being aware of these barriers, SFU Galleries can have more informed conversations and create inclusive moments, even when the initial instinct is to fix a problem and move on.</p>
<p>This Digital Strategy document and format strives to provide clear strategic direction and document the analysis and reasoning behind the recommendations to build trust and understanding and create content that can easily be shared with shareholders and funders.</p>
<p>Both the SFU Galleries Digital Strategy and the Digital Needs Assessment reports were written in HTML to be shared publically for transparency and accessibility and to provide a template to other public galleries that are engaged in assessments and digital audits. Please see the readme license information. This project openly acknowledges that we are all human and working to try and make the arts and culture community and industry more accessible - and that begins with allowing for mistakes, learning, and sharing.</p>
